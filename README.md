Wishing you a "Happy New Year" in an ECE Engineer's style

This repo has my Arduino sketch of the basic operation of '16*2 I2C LCD' and 'Seven Segmented Display(Common Anode type)' in the .ino extension file.
I also provided the code in a  separate .txt extension file.

Here is the link to the simulation of the project in the Wokwi simulator: https://wokwi.com/projects/418623624871951361
